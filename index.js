// ## Usage
// Provide instructions and examples for use. Include screenshots as needed.
// To add a screenshot, create an `assets/images` folder in your repository and upload your screenshot to it. Then, using the relative filepath, add it to your README using the following syntax:
//     ```md
//     ![alt text](assets/images/screenshot.png)
//     ```
// ## Credits
// List your collaborators, if any, with links to their GitHub profiles.
// If you used any third-party assets that require attribution, list the creators with links to their primary web presence in this section.
// If you followed tutorials, include links to those here as well.
// ## License
// The last section of a high-quality README file is the license. This lets other developers know what they can and cannot do with your project. If you need help choosing a license, refer to [https://choosealicense.com/](https://choosealicense.com/).

// üèÜ The previous sections are the bare minimum, and your project will ultimately determine the content of this document. You might also want to consider adding the following sections.
// ## Badges
// ![badmath](https://img.shields.io/github/languages/top/nielsenjared/badmath)
// Badges aren't necessary, per se, but they demonstrate street cred. Badges let other developers know that you know what you're doing. Check out the badges hosted by [shields.io](https://shields.io/). You may not understand what they all represent now, but you will in time.
// ## Features
// If your project has a lot of features, list them here.
// ## How to Contribute
// If you created an application or package and would like other developers to contribute it, you can include guidelines for how to do so. The [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) is an industry standard, but you can always write your own if you'd prefer.
// ## Tests
// Go the extra mile and write tests for your application. Then provide examples on how to run them here.
