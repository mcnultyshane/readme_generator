# Readme Generator

## Description

This project was designed by the University of Penn's Coding Bootcamp. We were to establish a high-quality Readme file in markdown format, only using the node.js terminal to launch the application.  We were to gather input from the user to fill out the markdown outline and generate a file for the user to apply to any project they may be completing.
